<h1>
Using The Serial Translator</h1></center>
The serial translator allow Niagara to talk to the drive through the serial
interface.&nbsp; Niagara currently supports all of the features of Serial
Debugger.&nbsp; Niagara will also support sending CDB commands to the drive
through the serial port, once the feature becomes available.&nbsp; In the
interest of user convenience, the serial interface translator is accessed
in a slightly different way than other translators.&nbsp; This allow the
serial translator to be used without explicitly switching to it.
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<h3>
The Basic Approach</h3></center>
When Niagara starts, it is ready to talk to the drive through the serial
port.&nbsp; To begin communication, connect a drive and type:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt><font color="#3333FF">secho</font></tt></blockquote>
This command attempts to connect to the drive through the serial interface.&nbsp;
Upon success, the drive will respond and you will see a message like the
following:
<p><img SRC="secho.gif" NOSAVE height=260 width=566>
<p>Note: The first serial command you run takes about 2 seconds to execute,
this is because the Serial Translator is calibrating the serial connection
based on the speed of your machine.
<p>The other useful commands besides secho are:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt><font color="#3333FF">sread &lt;address> &lt;length> ?-dw?
?-dd?</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">swrite &lt;address> &lt;length> ?-dw? ?-dd?
?hex data...?</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">sreadsp</font></tt></blockquote>
The sread command is used to read memory regions from the drive.&nbsp;
The swrite command writes them.&nbsp; The sreadsp command returns the current
location of the drive's stack pointer.&nbsp; All hexadecimal numbers must
be preceded with <tt><font color="#3333FF">0x</font></tt>.&nbsp; Here are
some examples of the commands in action:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt>sread 0 100</tt>
<br><tt>swrite 0x4000 0x10</tt>
<br><tt>swrite 0x4000 0x1 -dw 0x1234</tt></blockquote>
Note that, unlike Serial Debugger, Niagara uses the read and write buffers
in its operations.&nbsp; This means that all of the <tt><font color="#000099">buff</font></tt>
commands can be used to manipulate, load and save the buffer contents.&nbsp;
If the <tt><font color="#000099">swrite</font></tt> command is not given
any data on it's command line, buffer data is used (otherwise, the command
line data is put in the send buffer and then used).&nbsp; These two commands
groups, for example, are equivalent:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt><font color="#3333FF">swrite 0x4000 0x4 0x11 0x22 0x33
0x44</font></tt>
<p><tt><font color="#3333FF">bfs send 0 4 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">swrite 0x4000 0x4</font></tt></blockquote>

<h3>
suil - Trading Clarity For Convenience</h3></center>

<p><br>If you went through the last module on UIL translators you may be
confused as to why we do not need to switch our uil to the serial translator
to talk through the serial port.&nbsp; The reason is because the following
commands:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><tt><font color="#3333FF">sread</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">swrite</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">secho</font></tt>
<br><tt><font color="#3333FF">sreadsp</font></tt></blockquote>
point to a UIL that is set independently of the CDB commands.&nbsp; The
UIL pointed to is controlled by the <tt><font color="#3333FF">suil</font></tt>
command.&nbsp; A screenshot may clarify this:
<p><img SRC="suil.gif" height=272 width=511>
<p>This screenshot shows the uil list.&nbsp; It also shows that the current
uil for <i>CDB commands</i> (<tt><font color="#3333FF">read10</font></tt>,
<tt><font color="#3333FF">inquiry</font></tt>,
...) is set to zero.&nbsp; The current UIL for <i>serial commands</i> (<tt><font color="#3333FF">sread</font></tt>,
<tt><font color="#3333FF">swrite</font></tt>,
...) is set to 2.&nbsp; The separate categories allows us to use the serial
port at the same time we execute CDB's without having to type <tt><font color="#3333FF">uil
set index </font></tt>each time.
<p>This begs the question: can you call <tt><font color="#3333FF">uil set
index 2</font></tt>?&nbsp; can you call <tt><font color="#3333FF">suil
0</font></tt>?&nbsp; Yes, and yes.&nbsp; In the first case the result will
currently be "<font color="#FF0000">unsupported feature</font>" whenever
you execute a CDB (in our next generation of product the result will actually
be a CDB transfer over the serial line!)&nbsp; In the second case, the
driver will simply return "<font color="#FF0000">unsupported feature</font>"
every time you execute a serial command (because the spti driver does not
know or care how to handle serial packets).&nbsp; Here is an example:

GUI Utilities</h1></center>
All of the utilities supported by Serial Debugger are also supported under
Niagara.&nbsp; Here is how to reach them:

<br>&nbsp;
<p><img SRC="serial_gui2.gif" height=324 width=645>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here is a shot of Niagara's Address Lookup Dialog:
<p><img SRC="address_lookup.gif" NOSAVE height=361 width=305>
<p>See the Niagara documentation if you use dump files.&nbsp; Niagara has
full support for dump files but handles them in a slightly different way
than Serial Debugger does (Niagara takes advantages of its buffers, a feature
that Serial Debugger does not have).
