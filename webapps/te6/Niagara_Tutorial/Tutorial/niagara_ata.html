<title>Niagara: ATA Commands</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1 class="html_title">Niagara ATA Commands</h1>

Niagara has built in support for almost 200 ATA Commands. These commands are
parsed from a parameter file making it easy to add new commands and modify 
existing ones. To see a list of these commands use the function:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">get_ata_list</div><br>

This outputs a list of all defined ATA commands. To see this list sorted, type:
<br><br>
<div class="code_text">lsort [get_ata_list]</div><br>

To look at the options available to a CDB command, we will look at the read dma
extended command in depth. We'll start with:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">read_dma_ext -help</div><br>

This produces the following output:<br>
<div class="code_text"><pre>
****************************************

Command Name(s): read_dma_ext,rddmaex,rdmx

Description: Reads sectors from the disk using DMA.On UNC returns LBA of first fail.

Default Parm Order: lba, sect_count

Buffer Data Sent: &lt;None&gt;
Buffer Data Received: &lt;sect_count&gt; Blocks

Parameters:

    Name          Range           Default    | Description
    -----------------------------------------+----------------------------------
    -sect_count   (0-0xFF)        0x1        | Transfer Length in Sectors. Note: 0=65536
    -lba          (0-0xFF)        0x0        | Logical Block Address lower 32 bits
    -lbahigh      (0-0xFF)        0x0        | Logical Block Address upper 16 bits
    -uil          (0-?)           &lt;current&gt;  | Temporary UIL override
    -dev          (0-?)           &lt;current&gt;  | Temporary device index override
    -ri           (0-?)           &lt;current&gt;  | Temporary receive buffer override
    -cmd_timeout  (0-?)           0          | Persistent timeout override (0=no override)
    -dummy        (0-1)           0          | Don't actually send the command
</pre></div><br>

A lot of information is contained in this output:
<ul>
	<li>Command Name(s): This outputs the name of the command 
		(<font color=blue>read_dma_ext</font>) and any shorthand aliases 
		(<font color=blue>rddmaex, rdmx</font>)</li>
	<li>Description: Gives a brief description of the command's function</li>
	<li>Default Parm Order: This is the order that Niagara accepts parameters</li>
    <li>Buffer Data Sent: The amount of data this command transfers to the
	    target</li>
    <li>Buffer Data Received: The amount of data this command expects from the
	    target</li>
    <li>Parameters: These flags can be used to set options for the command.
	    Default operation is also indicated</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3 class="section_title">Different Forms of Read DMA</h3>

<div class="code_text">read_dma_ext<br>rddmaex<br>rdmx</div><br>

With no parameters, <font color=blue>read_dma_ext</font> is called with default
parameters. To see what these parameters are, check "Parameters" in the help.
<br><br>
<div class="code_text">read_dma_ext 123 5</div><br>

This command will read 5 sectors from LBA 123. The Default Parm Order in the 
help indicates the order in which the parameters occur.
<br><br>
<div class="code_text">
read_dma_ext -lba 123 -sect_count 5<br>
read_dma_ext -sect_count 5 -lba 123<br>
rdmx 123 -sect_count 5
</div><br>

These three commands are all equivalent to the previous command. When you 
specify the parameter name (ie. -lba) the order in which they come does not 
matter. As shown in the third command, you can mix both default and named
parameters, however after the first named parameter the rest must be named as
well.<br><br>

<div class="code_text">read_dma_ext -lba 123 -sect_count 5 -dummy 1</div><br>

When the "dummy" flag is set, the ATA command is not actually called. Instead 
the resulting FIS is returned.

<br>
<h3 class="section_title">Command Response Format</h3>

Below we see the response of a typical command:<br><br>
<img src="rdmx.gif" width=513 height=408><br><br>

This response contains several pieces of information:<br>
<ul>
	<li>CMD: The command FIS that was sent to the device</li>
	<li>RET: The return FIS from the device</li>
	<li>SATA: For SATA devices, the SATA Control Registers are displayed</li>
	<li>Hex Dump: This shows the information returned by the command, the 
	    information is also stored in our receive buffer (in the next section
		we look at buffers in detail)</li>
</ul>

One thing to note is that although 512 bytes were transferred, only 256 are
displayed. Niagara, by default, will truncate the returned data to 256 bytes
and indicate this with the "..." after the dump. The amount of data displayed
can be controlled with the following command:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">feedback maxlen &lt;bytes&gt;</div><br>

where maxlen is the maximum number of bytes you want displayed. Niagara will
display the lesser of either this number or the number actually returned.<br>

<br>
<h3 class="section_title">The Return FIS</h3>

The Return FIS is displayed and the values it contains are often useful for ATA
commands like <font color=blue>check_power_mode</font>. Parts of the FIS can be
returned with the following command:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">ata get &lt;value&gt;</div><br>

Where &lt;value&gt; is one of the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li>status: The status register</li>
	<li>error: The error register</li>
	<li>errlba: The combined 32bit lba</li>
	<li>errlbahi: The upper 16bits of the lba</li>
	<li>scr: The sector count register</li>
	<li>snr: The sector number register</li>
	<li>clr: The cylinder low register</li>
	<li>chr: The cylinder high register</li>
	<li>dhr: The device / head register</li>
</ul>

The SATA Control registers can also be retrieved with the following command:
<br><br>
<div class="code_text">sata get &lt;value&gt;</div><br>

Where &lt;value&gt; is one of the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li>status: The status register</li>
	<li>error: The error register</li>
	<li>control: The control register</li>
	<li>active: The active register</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3 class="section_title">NCQ Commands</h3>

Normally, when you enter a command in Niagara, Niagara will wait until the 
command completes before returning. This is not always ideal and Niagara 
provides two methods around the normal behavior:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">qmode stacked<br>qmode concurrent</div><br>

In stacked mode, each command you enter will be placed on a stack and they will
all be issued when you type <font color=blue>qctl send</font>. In concurrent 
mode, the commands are issued as you type them, but Niagara does not wait for 
them to complete before allowing the next one to be sent. This mode is more
useful in scripts as the delay to type in another command will probably be much
greater than the time needed to finish the first command. One thing to note is 
that not all drivers support queueing, and if they do not, they will return an
error when you try to set the queue mode. To receive outstanding commands use
the following commands (The first will receive one command, the second will
receive all commands):<br><br>
<div class="code_text">qctl recv<br>qctl recv all</div><br>

To see the order the commands returned in, as well as their status, issue the
following command:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">qctl table_info</div><br>

In order to keep track of outstanding commands, Niagara internally tags each
command sent to the drive. For ATA NCQ commands, there is also a tag stored in
the sector count register. These two tags need to line up, and you should not
issue two commands with the same tag simultaniously. You can either manually 
set tags and keep track of the outstanding ones, or you can let Niagara handle
the tags for you. To handle the tags yourself use the following commands:
<br><br>
<div class="code_text">qctl set next_tag 3<br>read_fpdma_queued -tag 3</div><br>

This will set the next tag Niagara uses to 3 and then issue a read fpdma 
command with a tag of 3. Another thing to note is that Niagara will handle the
bit shift of the tag when it places it in the sector count register. To let 
Niagara handle the tags for you, use the following commands:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">sata set_auto_tags on<br>read_fpdma_queued</div><br>

This will tell Niagara to handle the tag management and then issue a read fpdma
using the next available tag. To turn off this automatic handling of tags use
the following command:<br><br>
<div class="code_text">sata set_auto_tags off</div><br>

<br>
<h3 class="section_title">Aliases</h3>

The following aliases can be used in place of "0" and "1":<br>
<ul>
	<li>Zero: <font color=blue>0, false, no, stop</font></li>
	<li>One: <font color=blue>1, true, yes, start</font></li>
</ul>
